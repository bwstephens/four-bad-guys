# Chapter 11: The portal {-}

![](img/portal.jpg){width=400px}

A few hours later, Ave said, "We may have lost Endy but we still have tons of Life Gem magic -- more than I ever thought was possible. I think I can build a portal that will send the good guys galaxies away." So that's what she did. 

*Four days later...*

Ave launched the portal. We saw the portal, and we knew it was Ave's handywork. The portal began sucking up all the local villagers. We jumped in our spaceships to destroy the portal. It was a hard fight. At the end, the portal was going to suck up the gods. From a distance Ave was shooting pulse arrows. These arrows suck up magic. Felix, Malek, Alex, Mom, and I were all being sucked closer to the portal. Then a turbo switch opened on Felix's dashboard. Felix pressed the button and got free of the portal's grip. But then Felix heard me say, "Goodbye Felix." 

Alex, Malek, Mom, and I were all sucked in. 

Felix said, "No!" Felix started to cry. He had no idea what he was going to do next.
