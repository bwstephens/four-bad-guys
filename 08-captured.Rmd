# Chapter 8: Captured {-}

They put me in a cell in their space ship. 

"Set a course for Beckettâ€™s base," King Zombie said. 

I was sitting in my cell when I heard a voice. "Beckett -- it's me the Life Gem. I'm very proud that you...AAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!""

I heard Ave from outside the cell door, "I successfully sucked the magic out of the Life Gem." 

I put my head down I started to cry. "No," I said. But I felt like he was still alive, and he was. 

You see, the Life Gem was being recharged by me. I didn't know how at the time, but eventually the tank was holding too much magic and got too full and shut down Ave's magic-sucking contraption. The Life Gem got free. It hopped to me and then I turned into the Life God and said, "I look different."

The Life Gem said, "That means you can shoot a tree out of your hand."

"Cool!" I said.

Then I cut the bars using my Life Sword. Then I ran to docking area and climbed into my Life Ship. Then I formed the Life Sword on top of my Life Ship and cut the spaceship and flew out of the hole. The bad guys' space ship crashed in front of my base.
