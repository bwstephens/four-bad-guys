# Chapter 4: Endy {-}

There was Endy the Ender Dragon. King zombie said, "Open the gate, and let Endy in." 

He landed outside the door. King Zombie ran out and said, "Endy, what brings you here?" 

Endy said with a growl, "I want to see a Ave!!!"  

Just then Ave ran out the door. Endy said, "Two years ago King Ghast took control of all the bad guys. I knew that the bad guys were going to die, so I quit, and I promised to return when I would be needed. I woke up today with a plan. Ave, use your powers to make me stronger, faster, and more evil." 

"Sure,” Ave said pleased.
