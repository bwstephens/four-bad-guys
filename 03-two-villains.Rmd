# Chapter 3: Two villains {-}

After Herobrine Returns (the previous book) King Zombie took control of the bad guys. He was trying to find more leaders to help him. He was looking for a witch named Ave that helped him a long, long, long, time ago. He sent End Bot and his helpers to look for her. Just then -- Ding dong.

"Who is it?" King Zombie asked.

"It's me, Ave.”

"Come in," said King Zombie.

Ave walked in and said, "It's good to be back.” 

"Ave, you are now a boss for the bad guys. Step closer to receive your red violet badge and your black armor," said King Zombie.

Ave stepped closer and got her stuff. Then Commander Rip said, "King Zombie you have to see this!"

They looked out the window to see someone flying toward the gate. It was Endy.
