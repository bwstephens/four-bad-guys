# Chapter 10: Endyâ€™s last breath {-}

Mom said, "Malek and I will chase King Zombie, Ave, and Armstrong. Felix and Beckett will defeat Endy." Then Mom and Malek ran away. Felix and I got in our spaceships and started fighting Endy. But Endy was faster than our spaceships. He could heal very fast, and he was very, very strong. Endy hit our spaceships so hard with his tail our spaceships fell to the ground. 

"Oh no!" I said. 

"It is all over!" said Felix. 

Then we heard this: "Screech!!!!"

A few seconds later we saw Alex's big battleship! 

Alex said, "I told you it would be ready at the end of this book. Now, let's go fight Endy." 

I said, "Okay!" 

Endy attacked but he could hardly make a dent in Alex's new ship before he got hurt. Endy was so distracted by the battleship that he didn't see me in my spaceship. I formed the sword on top of my spaceship and I slashed Endy with it. Eventually Endy fell to the ground. When the dust cleared Endy was no more.
